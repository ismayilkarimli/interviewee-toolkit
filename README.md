# Interviewee Toolkit

The repository contains the notes I make while preparing for technical interviews.

Documentation is done using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Leetcode problems are taken from the curated list of [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?order=difficulty&weeks=26).
