# [Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/description/)

Difficulty:  Medium
Topic: Array
Hint: When you add a new interval to a sorted list -> a) newInterval doesn't overlap because it comes before current interval. b) newInterval doesn't overlap because it comes after current interval. c) newInterval overlaps d) newInterval doesn't overlap because it after all intervals.
### Explanation:
Iterate over the intervals. Then, inside the loop, check if `newInterval[1]` is less than current interval's start. If yes, it means the `newInterval` should go before the current interval. So, append the `newInterval` to the result, and then append rest of the elements in the `intervals` array, then `return` the result. If `newInterval[0]` is greater than the current interval's end, then it means `newInterval` and current interval don't overlap, append the current `interval` to the result list. If neither of those conditions is true, then it means there's an overlap since `newInterval[1]` is greater than the current `interval[0]` and `newInterval[0]` is less than `interval[1]`. In the case of overlap, take the minimum start between `newInterval` and current `interval` start, and maximum of `newInterval` and current `interval` end. Once the loop is over, it means `newInterval` was never added, so add it to the result, then return. 

##### Steps:

1. Create empty `result = []`
2. Iterate over the array `for i, interval in enumerate(intervals)`
3. One of 3 conditions could be the case:
	1. `if newInterval[1] < interval[0]` - no overlap as `newInterval` should be added before current `interval`: `res.append(newInterval)`, then `return res + intervals[i:]`
	2. `if newInterval[0] > interval[1]`, - no overlap `newInterval` is greater than current `interval` end: `res.append(interval)`
	3. `else` means there's an overlap: `newInterval = [min(interval[0], newInterval[0]), max(interval[1], newInterval[1])]`
4. If loop terminated without executing return, then `newInterval` was never added. `res.append(newInterval)` and `return result`


### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        for i, interval in enumerate(intervals):
            if newInterval[1] < interval[0]:
                res.append(newInterval)
                return res + intervals[i:]
            elif newInterval[0] > interval[1]:
                res.append(interval)
            else:
                newInterval = [min(interval[0], newInterval[0]), max(interval[1], newInterval[1])]
        
        res.append(newInterval)
        return res

```
