# [Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/description/)

Difficulty: #Medium
Topic: #Arrays
Hint: When you add a new interval to a sorted list -> a) newInterval doesn't overlap because it comes before current interval. b) newInterval doesn't overlap because it comes after current interval. c) newInterval overlaps d) newInterval doesn't overlap because it comes after all intervals.
### Explanation:
Iterate over the intervals. Then, inside the loop, check if `newInterval` end is less than current interval's start. If yes, it means the `newInterval` should go before the current interval. So, append the `newInterval` to the result, and then append rest of the elements in the `intervals` array, then `return` the result. If `newInterval` start is greater than the current interval's end, then it means `newInterval` and current interval don't overlap because `newInterval` comes after the current interval. Append the current `interval` to the result list. If neither of those conditions is true, then it means there's an overlap since `newInterval` end is GTE the current `interval` start and `newInterval` start is LTE to `interval` end. In the case of overlap, take the minimum start between `newInterval` and current `interval` start, and maximum of `newInterval` and current `interval` end. Once the loop is over, it means `newInterval` was never added since the `return` statement within the loop hasn't executed. So add it to the result, then `return`. 

##### Steps:
1. Create empty `result = []`
2. Iterate over the array `for i, interval in enumerate(intervals)`
3. One of 3 conditions could be the case:
	1. `if newInterval[1] < interval[0]` - no overlap as `newInterval` should be added before current `interval`: `res.append(newInterval)`, then `return res + intervals[i:]`
	2. `if newInterval[0] > interval[1]`, - no overlap `newInterval` is greater than current `interval` end: `res.append(interval)`
	3. `else` means there's an overlap: `newInterval = [min(interval[0], newInterval[0]), max(interval[1], newInterval[1])]`
4. If loop terminated without executing return, then `newInterval` was never added. `res.append(newInterval)` and `return result`


### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        for i, interval in enumerate(intervals):
            if newInterval[1] < interval[0]:
                # edge case 1: new interval should go before current interval
                res.append(newInterval)

                # since all other intervals are non overlapping append them
                return res + intervals[i:]
            elif newInterval[0] > interval[1]:
                # edge case 2: new interval should come after current interval
                res.append(interval)
            else:
                # there's an overlap
                # modify newInterval
                newInterval = [min(newInterval[0], interval[0]), max(newInterval[1], interval[1])]
                
                # don't add to result because might overlap with future intervals

        # newInterval was never added (since return statement in loop didn't get executed)
        res.append(newInterval)

        return res

```
