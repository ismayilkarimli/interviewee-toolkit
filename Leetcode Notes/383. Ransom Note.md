# [383. Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/)

Difficulty:  #Easy 
Topic: #HashMap 
Hint: Create hashmap to count letters in one string, then compare with the letters in the other string
###### Short description:
Given two strings, determine if first string can be constructed using the other

### Explanation:

Create an empty map. Then loop through letters in the magazine string and put their count in the map. Then, loop through the letters in the second string and if any letter doesn't exist in the map, then return false. If letter exists in the map, then decrement its count, if count reaches below 0, return false as it means the letter has been used more than once.

##### Steps:

1. Create `letters = {}`
2. Then, `for letter in magazine`
	1. `if letter in letters`, then `letters[letter] += 1`
	2. `else letters[letter] = 1`
3. Then, for `for letter in ransomNote`
	1. `if letter in letters`, then `letters[letter] -= 1` to decrement count
		1. `if letters[letter] < 0`, then it means letter has been used more than once, `return False`
	2. `else return False` because the `letter` doesn't exist in `magazine`
4. `return True` in the end


### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        letters = {}

        for letter in magazine:
            # for each letter in magazine
            if letter in letters:
                # increment letter count if it doesn't exist
                letters[letter] += 1
            else:
                # add letter to map
                letters[letter] = 1

        for letter in ransomNote:
            # for each letter in ransomNote
            if letter in letters:
                # if letter is in the magazine then reduce its count
                letters[letter] -= 1
                if letters[letter] < 0:
                    # letter has been used more than once
                    return False
            else:
                # letter is not in the magazine letters
                return False

        return True

```
