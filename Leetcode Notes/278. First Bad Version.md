# [278. First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

Difficulty:  #Easy 
Topic: #TwoPointers #BinarySearch 
Hint: Use left and right pointers to arrive at the lowest version

###### Short description:
Given number `n` that represents the highest version number. Find out starting from which version, the version is broken.

### Explanation:

The trick is to use two pointers. First pointer will point to the first version, second pointer to the last. Loop while the pointers haven't met. If the current midpoint is a bad version, then shift the left pointer to one less than midpoint, as it means there could be earlier bad versions. Otherwise, shift the left pointer by midpoint + 1, as it means, the first bad version is to the right of the midpoint.

##### Steps:

1. Create `left, right = 1, n` pointers
2. Loop `while left <= right`.
	1. Calculate `midpoint = (left + right) / 2`
	2. `if isBadVersion(midpoint)`, then `right = midpoint - 1`.
	3. `else left = midpoint + 1`
3. Out of the loop, `return left`
### Code:

```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        # left and right pointers
        l, r = 1, n

        while l <= r:
            # while left pointer hasn't meet or passed right
            # calculate midpoint
            m = (l + r) // 2 
            if isBadVersion(m):
                # if midpoint is a bad version, then there could be even lower to the right
                # shift the right pointer
                r = m - 1
            else:
                # mid point is a good version, shift the left pointer
                l = m + 1
        
        # left pointer should point to the lowest bad version
        return l
        
```
