# [543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #BinaryTree #DFS 
Hint: Calculate diameter of the tree from each node. At each node, potentially update the maximum diameter of the entire tree

### Explanation:
The idea is to find diameter of the tree from each node. Then once, the diameter is known, compare it to the global diameter, and potentially update it. Then, return the height of the tree.

##### Steps:
1. `diameter = 0` defines a maximum diameter of the tree
2. `def dfs(root):` DFS traversal function
	1. `if not root: return 0` in case of null node, height is `0`
	2. `left = dfs(root.left) right = dfs(root.right)` calculate left and right tree heights
	3. `current_diameter = left + right` once the height of each branch is known, diameter is the sum of heights of each branch
	4. `diameter = max(current_diameter, diameter)` potentially update the diameter
	5. `return 1 + max(left, right)` return height of the current tree in the end
3. `dfs(root)` to start the DFS from the root
4. `return diameter`

### Code:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        diameter = 0
        def dfs(root):
            nonlocal diameter
            if not root:
                return 0

            left = dfs(root.left)
            right = dfs(root.right)

            # diameter of the current node
            current_diameter = left + right

            # potentially update max diameter
            diameter = max(current_diameter, diameter)

            return 1 + max(left, right)
        
        dfs(root)
        return diameter
```
