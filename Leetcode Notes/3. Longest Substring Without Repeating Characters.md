# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #Arrays #SlidingWindow 
Hint: Set can't have duplicates. While set has the element that's causing duplication, remove set elements from the left

### Explanation:
Initialize two pointers `l, r = 0, 0`. Pointer `l` will stay fixed, while `r` is advancing the window. While `s[r]` is not in the set, it means there're no duplicates, `set.add(s[r])` and advance right pointer `r += 1`. Once a duplicate is encountered, start popping `set` elements from the left `set.remove(s[l])` and advance the left pointer `l`. Variable that keeps track of the maximum length should be updated after each iteration and returned in the end

##### Steps:
1. `l, r = 0, 0` two pointers
2. `max_len = 0` maximum substring length
3. `sub = set()` set of characters (can also be a list with slight modifications)
4. `while r < len(s)` while right pointer is within the bounds
	1. `while s[r] in sub` while set has the current character, a duplication exists
	2. `sub.remove(s[l])` pop elements from the left and advance `l += 1` at each step
5. `sub.add(s[r])` once there are no duplicates, add current character to the set
6. `max_len = max(r - l + 1, max_len)` recalculate maximum length
7. `r += 1` advance right pointer

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 0
        max_len = 0
        sub = set()

        while r < len(s):
            while s[r] in sub:
                sub.remove(s[l])
                l += 1
            # no duplicates below here
            sub.add(s[r])
            max_len = max(r - l + 1, max_len)
            r += 1
        return max_len
```
