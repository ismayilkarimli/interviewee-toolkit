# [49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #HashMap 
Hint: Store letter combination as key and list of strings as a value

### Explanation:
The main idea is to count the letter combination for each given string. Since its given that letters are only lowercase, English letters, maximum size is 26. For each string, create an array to store appearance count of the letters as the key. Then, if such a combination does not exist in the hashmap, then create it with a list containing the current string as value. If it exists, add the current string to the list in the value.

##### Steps:
1. `res = {}` result hashmap
2. `for s in strs:` for each string in given strings
	1. `count = [0] * 26` create empty array to count letter appearances
	2. `for c in s: count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1` increment appearance of the letter in the array
3. Then, if the hashmap `res` has that combination as a key, then add string to the list, otherwise create a key value pairing.
### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        res = {}

        for s in strs:
            # to keep count of each letter in the string
            count = [0] * 26
            
            # construct list with count of letters
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1
            
            # (python doesn't allow list as hm key so use tuple)
            # store string under a given letter combination tuple
            if tuple(count) in res:                
                res[tuple(count)].append(s)
            else:
                res[tuple(count)] = [s]
                
        return res.values()

```
