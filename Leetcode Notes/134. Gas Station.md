# [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

Hint: `if sum(gas) >= sum(cost)` a solution is guaranteed to exist

### Explanation:
A solution can only exist if the amount of gas is greater than or equal to the amount of cost to travel. After making this check, a solution is guaranteed to exist. Create a `start` and `tank` variables to represent starting position and how much tank there's. Then, loop through the array and calculate the tank at the current index. If tank is positive, it means travelling was possible, so the loop can be continued normally. However, if the tank was negative, it means it is not possible to travel to this cell. Reset `tank = 0` and change the starting index `start = i + 1`. Setting `start += 1` would also work, however, the current iteration could only be reached if tank was at least `0`. Meaning, since the tank went below `0` despite being at least `0`, no matter which previous index was the starting point, it would have went below `0` regardless.

##### Steps:

1. `if sum(gas) < sum(cost): return -1` (Guaranteed to have position after this)
2. `for i in range(len(gas)):`
	1. `tank += (gas[i] - cost[i])` update tank
	2. `if tank < 0` travel is not possible, reset `tank = 0` and `start = i + 1`
3. `return start` once the loop terminates


### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        # if total amount of gas is less than the total cost, then a circle can't be completed
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
            return -1

        # guaranteed to have a solution if reached here
        # since solution is guaranteed there's no need to make a circle by setting i = 0 when it reaches end
        tank = 0
        start = 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            tank += (gas[i] - cost[i])

            if tank < 0:
                # try start from the next index, since tank went below 0
                tank = 0
                start = i + 1            
        return start
```
