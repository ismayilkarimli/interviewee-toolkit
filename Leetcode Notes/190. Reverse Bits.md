# [190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #BitManipulation 
Hint: Take right-most bit of n, append it to result, then shift n to the right and result to the left.

### Explanation:
The idea is basically to take right-most bit from the given number, shift the result to the left to make space for the new bit, then add it to the result. Then shift the given number to the right to update the right-most bit. Continue this for every bit (32 bits)
##### Steps:
1. For 32 bits
2. take the last bit from `n`. `n & 1` gives the last bit, since it'll output `0` if the bit is `0` and `1` if the bit is `1`.
3. Then shift result to the left by `1` to make space for the new bit
4. Add the new bit to the result by bitwise OR. This works because it'll add `1` to the result if the bit is `1` and `0` if the bit is `0`.
5. Shift `n` to the right by `1` to process the next right-most bit

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(32):
            # get the bit (returns 1 if bit is 1, otherwise 0)
            bit = n & 1

            # shift res to the left by 1 bit to make space for the new bit
            res = res << 1

            # add new bit to the result (1 if bit is 1, 0 otherwise)
            res |= bit

            # shift n to the right to update the right-most bit
            n = n >> 1
        return res
```
