# [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #BitManipulation
Hint: Remove right-most set bit (rightmost 1) at each iteration until there's a bit to remove and count removals.

### Explanation:
The idea is to remove right-most set bit at every iteration and count it. Once there's no right-most bit to remove then, the result can be returned. To remove the right-most `1` bit, flip the bit and following bits by subtracting 1 from the `n`. This will effectively flip the right-most 1 bit as well as any following bits to the right. For example In the case of `1100`, the right-most set bit is the 2nd 1, when `n-1=11=>1011` the right-most `1` as well as the bits to the right of it are flipped. Now, to remove these bits, bitwise AND it with the `n` itself, and increment the counter. Repeat the process while there's a right-most set bit to remove. Continuing the example, bitwise AND returns `1000=8`, flip the right-most `1` bit to zero and following `0s` to `1`by doing `8-1=7=>0111`. Bitwise AND `1000 & 0111 = 0000`. The process is done.

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n > 0:
            # remove the right-most bit
            n &= (n - 1)

            # increment count for each right-most bit removed
            res += 1
        return res
```
