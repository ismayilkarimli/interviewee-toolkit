# [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #BitManipulation #XOR
Hint: XOR all array, all duplicate numbers will cancel each other out and the single number will remain

### Explanation:
The optimal solution can be done by XOR-ing all elements of the array. In XOR-ing the order doesn't matter. The property is `a ⊕ a = 0` and `a ⊕ 0 = a`. If the array is `[4,1,2,1,2]`, then XOR-ing all elements is effectively saying `4 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 2 = 4`, since 1s and 2s will XOR each other out, only `4` will remain.

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0

        for num in nums:
            # XOR all numbers of the array
            res ^= num
        
        return res
```
