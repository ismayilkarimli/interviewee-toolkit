# [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)

Difficulty:  #Medium
Topic: #Arrays
Hint: Product of numbers preceding * Product of numbers succeeding
### Explanation:
Without using division, it is possible to find what the product of all other integers in the array is by knowing the product of numbers preceding a given number and product of numbers succeeding a given number. First iterate through the numbers in regular order, and set the given number index to the current prefix, then update the prefix so the next number also includes the current number in the prefix. Then, iterate over the numbers in reverse order and multiply the `res[i]` which stores the prefix value for a given index, with the current postfix value. Then update the postfix, so that it includes the current number in the next iteration.

##### Steps:

1. Create array of the same size as numbers. Populate with 1s
2. Initial `prefix = 1`, then `for i in range(len(nums))`, set the prefix for current number, to the current `res[i] = prefix`, then update the `prefix *= nums[i]` to include current number in the next iteration
3. Initial `postfix = 1`, iterate in reverse order `for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1)`, and, multiple product of numbers preceding current number with the postfix `res[i] *= postfix`, and update the `postfix *= nums[i]`
4. Finally, `return res`


### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [1] * len(nums)

        # calculate prefixes
        prefix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # product of preceding numbers
            res[i] = prefix

            # update prefix
            prefix *= nums[i]
        
        # calculate postfix
        postfix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            # product of succeeding numbers
            res[i] *= postfix

            # update postfix
            postfix *= nums[i]
        return res
```
