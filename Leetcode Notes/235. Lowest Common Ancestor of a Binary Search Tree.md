# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

Link to the problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/  
Difficulty: #Medium  
Topics: #BinaryTree #BST  
Hint: In Binary Search Tree (BST), smaller values to the current node go in the left subtree, while greater values to the right one.

In the question, you are given a BST and two nodes (`p` and `q`). The task is to find the lowest common ancestor of the those nodes in the given tree.

### Explanation:

Lower values are stored on the left subtree, while greater ones in the right. Hence, it is enough to explore single subtree if both values are larger or smaller than the root value. If, one value is smaller than root value, while the other one is greater, then current root is their only common ancestor, as well as the smallest one.

##### Steps:

1. loop over the current root
2. inside the while loop
   1. if `p` and `q` fall on the left subtree, then set the current root to left subtree
   2. if `p` and `q` fall on the right subtree, then set the current root to right subtree
   3. else, return the current root (either one of the values is equal to the current root or they are located in different branches)

### Code:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        current_root = root
        while current_root:
            # while the node exists
            if p.val < current_root.val and q.val < current_root.val:
                # both nodes are on the left subtree
                current_root = current_root.left
            elif p.val > current_root.val and q.val > current_root.val:
                # both nodes are on the right subtree
                current_root = current_root.right
            else:
                # the nodes are on different subtrees
                # hence, common ancestor is current root
                return current_root
```
