# [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

Difficulty: 
Topic: 
Hint: 

### Explanation:
This problem can be solved using BFS or DFS. The idea is that the first time an unexplored `1` is seen, then it must be a new island, therefore, increase the island count. Then, explore all neighbors of the current cell using BFS or DFS.
##### Steps:
1. Start a loop going through each cell
2. `if (r, c) not in visited and grid[r][c] == "1":` if an unvisited `1` is seen, then it must be a new island, `islands += 1`
3. `q = deque([(r, c)])` add it to queue as the starting point
4. Do a regular BFS search (replacing `popleft()` with `pop` is enough to make the solution DFS)
5. Get the neighbor directions, and if they are in range, not being visited, and `1`, then add its coordinates to the queue to explore it as well.

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # edge cases
        if not grid:
            return 0
        
        directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = set()
        islands = 0

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if (r, c) not in visited and grid[r][c] == "1":
                    # unexplored 1 = new island
                    islands += 1

                    # start bfs from the current 1 and explore its neighbors
                    q = deque([(r, c)])
                    while q:
                        row, col = q.popleft()

                        # get neighbors of the 1
                        for dr, dc in directions:
                            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc

                            # if neighbor is 1 and hasn't been visited
                            if nr in range(rows) and nc in range(cols) and grid[nr][nc] == "1" and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                                # mark it for next visit
                                q.append((nr, nc))
                                
                                # add it to visited
                                visited.add((nr, nc))
        return islands
```
