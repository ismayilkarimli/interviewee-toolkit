# [542. 01 Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #BFS

### Explanation:
Create initial result array and populate with infinity values. Go through all cells in the matrix, and mark cells that have value of `0` as `0` in the result array and store their coordinates in a `queue`. Then, start the BFS process by getting the coordinates from the queue, calculating coordinates of the neighbors in 4 directions, then checking if adding `1` to the current cell value is less than the neighbor's current value (meaning there's a shorter way to reach the neighboring cell). If yes, then update the neighbor value and append its coordinates to the `queue` (so its neighbors can be explored).

##### Steps:
1. `distance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]` populate cells with infinity
2. Go through all matrix values and set `distance[r][c]` as `0` if `mat[r][c] == 0`
3. Append 0's coordinates to the queue
4. Start BFS by going through all `queue` values.
	1. Pop the leftmost coordinates
	2. Calculate the neighbor coordinates
	3. If neighbor coordinates are within the bounds, then check if its shorter to reach the neighbor from current cell than its existing shortest path
		1. If yes, then update the neighbors value
		2. append neighbor's coordinates to the queue
5. return `distance` array

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        rows, cols = len(mat), len(mat[0])

        # populate all cells with infinity
        distance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
        queue = deque()

        # enqueue all zeros and set their distance to 0
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if mat[r][c] == 0:
                    queue.append((r, c))
                    distance[r][c] = 0

        directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]

        # bfs
        while queue:
            r, c = queue.popleft()
            for dr, dc in directions:
                # calculate neighbor coordinates
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                # check neighbor within bounds
                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
                    # if the previously recorded distance to the nearest zero for the neighbor cell greater than the distance 
                    # from the current cell plus one step
                    if distance[nr][nc] > distance[r][c] + 1:
                        # shorter step found, update neighbor value
                        distance[nr][nc] = distance[r][c] + 1

                        # enqueue the neighbor to continue bfs
                        queue.append((nr, nc))

        return distance
```
