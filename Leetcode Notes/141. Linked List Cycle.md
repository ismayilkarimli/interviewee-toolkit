# [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

Difficulty: #Easy  
Topic: #TwoPointers
Hint: Create a slow and fast pointers. Slow advances by 1, fast by 2. If these points ever meet, then there's a cycle

##### Short description:
A LinkedList is given, detect if it has a cycle
### Explanation:

The optimal solution is to use two pointers - slow and fast. Both of these pointers will start at the first given head. While, fast pointer and `fast.next` (since fast is moving by 2) is not null, continue looping. Advance slow pointer by 1 and fast by 2. If the pointers point to the same node, return `True`. Out of the loop return `False` as it would mean the fast pointer reached null, meaning there's an end to the given LinkedList. 

If there's a cycle, it is guaranteed that the pointers will meet. Let's say distance between the pointers is $D$. Slow pointer moves by $x$, while fast one by $2x$. Meaning, at each step, the distance changes by the following: $D = D + x - 2x = D - x$, therefore after some iterations, $D$ will become 0.

##### Steps:

1. Initialize two pointers `slow` and `fast` both pointing to the given `head`.
2. Loop while `fast` and `fast.next` exist.
3. Inside the loop, advance `slow` by 1 by doing `slow.next` and `fast` by 2 by doing `fast.next.next`.
4. If `slow` and `fast` are equal, then cycle exists, `return True`
5. Outside the loop `return False`


### Code:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        # initially both pointers are at the same node
        slow, fast = head, head

        while fast and fast.next:
            # while fast pointer hasn't reached the end
            
            # advance slow by 1 and fast by 2
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

            # if pointers have met again it means there's a cycle
            if slow == fast:
                return True
        
        # fast pointer reached end of the list
        return False
```
