# [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #TwoPointers 
Hint: Use two pointers at the start and end of the sorted array; if their sum is less than the target, move the left pointer right; if greater, move the right pointer left. When they match the target, return the 1-based indices.

### Explanation:
The idea is to use a two-pointer technique since the array is already sorted. We start with one pointer `l` at the beginning of the array and the other pointer `r` at the end. The goal is to adjust these pointers until we find the pair that adds up to the target.

To do this, initialize `l` and `r` at the start and end, respectively. Calculate the sum of the values at `l` and `r`. If the sum is less than the target, it means we need a larger sum, so we move the l pointer one step to the right. If the sum is greater than the target, we need a smaller sum, so we move the r pointer one step to the left.

When the sum matches the target, return the indices of `l` and `r`, adjusted for 1-based indexing as required by the problem. The solution only requires a single pass through the array, updating pointers based on the sum comparison, resulting in an efficient `O(n)` time complexity. This approach leverages the sorted nature of the array to avoid nested loops, effectively narrowing down the solution space with each pointer adjustment.

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1

        while l < r:
            sum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
            if sum < target:
                l += 1
            elif sum > target:
                r -= 1
            else:
                return [l + 1, r + 1]
        return [-1, -1]
```
