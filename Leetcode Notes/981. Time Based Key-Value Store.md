# [981. Time Based Key-Value Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #BinarySearch
Hint: Search values using binary search

### Explanation:
Store values in a map where `key - [value, timestamp]`. Then, when a value is requested, if the key is in the map, then search can be done with Binary Search to achieve the optimal solution. Retrieve the values associated with the key from the map, then do a regular binary search. The goal is to retrieve the value of the key at the requested timestamp. However, when value with that exact timestamp doesn't exist, then the return the value with the greatest timestamp that is less than the requested timestamp. In other words, when the midpoint is larger than the requested timestamp, shift the right pointer. Otherwise, associate the result with the current value and shift the left pointer in case there's a value with larger timestamp to the right.
### Code:

```python
class TimeMap:

    def __init__(self):
        self.map = {}
        
    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        # key - [value, ts]
        if key not in self.map:
            self.map[key] = []
        self.map[key].append([value, timestamp])
        
    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
        res = ""
        if key in self.map:
            # get values of the key
            values_timestamps = self.map[key]

            left, right = 0, len(values_timestamps) - 1

            while left <= right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2
                if values_timestamps[mid][1] > timestamp:
                    right = mid - 1
                elif values_timestamps[mid][1] < timestamp:
                    left = mid + 1
                    res = values_timestamps[mid][0]
                else:
                    return values_timestamps[mid][0]

        return res
```
