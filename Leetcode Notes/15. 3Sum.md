# [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

Difficulty: Medium
Topic: Arrays
Hint: Use 1 fixed + 2 moving pointers each iteration
### Explanation:
First, sort the array. Then, iterate through the array. `if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]`, then `continue` current iteration to avoid duplicates in the result. If the continue block isn't hit, then create pointers `j = i + 1` and `k = len(nums) - 1`. Create a second loop to iterate `while j < k`. Calculate `sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k]`. Since the numbers are sorted, we know if the number is less than 0, it means `j` pointer should be advanced, if its greater than 0, then `k` pointer should advance to the left. If the `sum = 0`, then append the 3 numbers to the result array. After appending, `while nums[j] == nums[j - 1] and j < k`, advance the `j` pointer. Once the outer loop terminates, `return res`

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        res = []

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                # if current number same as previous skip iteration
                continue
            j, k = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
            while j < k:
                sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k]
                if sum < 0:
                    # to increase sum, advance j
                    j += 1
                elif sum > 0:
                    # to decrease sum, advance k
                    k -= 1
                else:
                    res.append([nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]])

                    # advance j pointer
                    j += 1
                    while nums[j] == nums[j - 1] and j < k:
                        # while j points to the same number, advance it
                        j += 1
        return res
```
