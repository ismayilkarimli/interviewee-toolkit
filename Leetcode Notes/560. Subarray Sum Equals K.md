# [560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #Arrays 
Hint: The goal is to find the number of subarray sums that when removed from the current sum results in `k`

### Explanation:
The problem can we solved with the following logic. At each step, calculate the sum of the subarray up until the current point, and store it in the hashmap with sum as the key and the number of times that sum has been seen as the value. Since non-positive values are allowed, the same sum can be seen multiple times. If we have the sums of every subarray, then at each point we can ask the question, is there a subarray sum, that if removed from the current sum, will give us `k`? In other words, `currentSum - k = subarraySum`, when solved for `k`, this equation is `k = currentSum - subarraySum`. Count all such instances, then keep the record of the current subarray sum too. Initially the sum - occurrence hashmap should contain `{ 0 : 1 }` to account for the edge case, where `currentSum - k = 0`. 

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # result to hold counts of sum = k
        res = 0

        # hold sum of subarrays up until the current point (0 : 1 as edge to handle when sum = k, also initial sum = 0)
        subarraySums = { 0 : 1 }

        # initially subarray sum is 0
        curSum = 0
        for num in nums:
            curSum += num

            # check if subarray sum exists such that curr - subarr = k (basically if we remove that subarray, we find k)
            subarrSum = curSum - k
            if subarrSum in subarraySums:
                res += subarraySums[subarrSum]
            
            # add sum of current subarray to hashmap
            subarraySums[curSum] = subarraySums.get(curSum, 0) + 1

        return res
```
