# [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #LinkedList 
Hint: To reverse a linked list, reverse the direction of the next pointers

### Explanation:
To reverse a linked list, it is enough to reverse the next pointer of each node. Meaning the first node should point to none, the second none to the first, third to the second and so on. To achieve this, it is needed to create new LinkedList using new nodes with reverse next pointers. A variable is needed to hold the next node value. Since for the first node, this should be null, initialize it as such. Then iterate through all nodes of the given LinkedList. For each node, create a new `ListNode` with current value of the head as the value, and value of the `next` pointer as the its next pointer. Then, update the next to point to the newly created node, since the subsequent node's `next` value should be the currently created node. In the end, return the new node as the solution.
### Code:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        next = None
        node = None

        # advance head till the end
        while head:
            # create a copy of the current node
            node = ListNode(head.val, next)

            # update next to point to the created node
            next = node
            
            # advance head
            head = head.next
        
        return node
```
