# [79. Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #Backtracking #DFS 
Hint: Explore options from every cell until it becomes invalid (letters don't match, visiting existing cell, or OOB)

### Explanation:
Basically, take each cell and visit all neighboring cells one by one as long as the path is valid. For a path to be a valid, it needs to be in-bounds, not in the current path (visiting for the first time in this iteration), and its value needs to match the word's character at the current index. If a cell satisfies these conditions, then add it to the visiting path and explore all options from it. Once the exploration is done, remove the cell from the visiting list and return its result.

##### Steps:
1. `if i == len(word): return True` - base case
2. `if r not in range(rows) or c not in range(cols) or board[r][c] != word[i] or (r, c) in visiting: return False` - check the conditions
3. `visiting.add((r, c))` mark as getting visited
4. `res = (dfs(r + 1, c, i + 1) or dfs(r - 1, c, i + 1) or dfs(r, c + 1, i + 1) or dfs(r, c - 1, i + 1))` explore all neighboring cells
5. `visiting.remove((r, c))` no longer visiting
6. `return res`

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])
        visiting = set()
        
        def dfs(r, c, i):
            # check if reached EOW
            if i == len(word):
                return True
            
            # in case out of bounds, already visited, or current index char doesn't match with the word
            if r not in range(rows) or c not in range(cols) or board[r][c] != word[i] or (r, c) in visiting:
                return False

            # mark cell as visiting
            visiting.add((r, c))
            res = (dfs(r + 1, c, i + 1) or dfs(r - 1, c, i + 1) or dfs(r, c + 1, i + 1) or dfs(r, c - 1, i + 1))
            
            # once visited paths from the cell, remove it
            visiting.remove((r, c))

            return res
            
        
        # Start from each cell
        for row in range(rows):
            for col in range(cols):
                # try each cell
                if dfs(row, col, 0):
                    return True
        return False

```
