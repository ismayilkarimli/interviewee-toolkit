# [739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #Stack 
Hint: Use a stack to store indices of days with unresolved temperatures. For each day, if the current temperature is warmer than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack, pop the index, calculate the difference in days, and store it in the answer array. Continue until no warmer day is found, then push the current day onto the stack.

### Explanation:
The solution uses a monotonic stack to track temperatures that haven't found their next warmer day. For each temperature, while the current temperature is warmer than the top of the stack, temperatures are popped from the stack and their waiting days are calculated by finding the difference between current index and their stored index. After processing previous temperatures, the current temperature-index pair is pushed onto the stack. This approach works because temperatures stay on the stack until a warmer day is found, and the stack's decreasing order ensures only relevant future days are compared. The solution initializes the answer array with zeros to handle cases where no warmer temperature is found, and stores temperature-index pairs in the stack to both compare temperatures and calculate the waiting days in a single pass through the array.

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # initialize answers array = len(tempratures), default val 0
        answer = [0] * len(temperatures)

        # (temp, index)
        stack = []

        for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
            if not stack:
                stack.append((t, i))
                continue
            # peek while valid and less than curr
            while stack and stack[-1][0] < t:
                _, ind = stack.pop()
                answer[ind] = i - ind
            stack.append((t, i))

        return answer            
```
