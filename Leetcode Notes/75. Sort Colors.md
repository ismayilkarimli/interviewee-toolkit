# [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

Difficulty: Medium
Topic: Arrays
Hint: 
### Explanation:
Use left pointer to determine where 0s are, and use the right pointer to determine where the 1s are. Regular `i` pointer should iterate through the array, and move 0s to left pointer index and 2s to the right pointer index. At the end of each iteration, `i` should be advanced. However, it could be that the number at the right pointer was 0 before, and swapping then advancing `i` could result in that 0 not getting swapped with the left pointer. Therefore, after swapping with the right pointer, loop should not advance. The loop should iterate while `i` hasn't reached the right pointer.

##### Steps:

1. Create `l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1` and `i = 0`
2. `while i <= r`
	1. `if nums[i] == 0: swap(i, l) l+= 1`
	2. `if nums[i] == 2: swap(i, r) r+= 1` and `i -= 1` to prevent loop advancement
	3. `i += 1` to advance the loop


### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        i = 0

        def swap(i, j):
            temp = nums[i]
            nums[i] = nums[j]
            nums[j] = temp
        
        while i <= r:
            if nums[i] == 0:
                swap(l, i)
                l += 1
            elif nums[i] == 2:
                swap(i, r)
                r -= 1
                i -= 1
            i += 1
```
