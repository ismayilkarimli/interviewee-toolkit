Hint: HashMap to store occurrences of letters in a word

###### Short description:
Given two strings, determine if they are anagrams.

### Explanation:

In short, we will use a hashmap to store letter as the key and its count as value. First, iterate over the first string to fill the hashmap. Create a second loop and iterate over the second string and compare with the hashmap. If the letter is not a key in the hashmap, then it means it did not exist in the first string, therefore, the strings are not anagrams. Otherwise, decrement the value for key, if value reaches 0, remove the key from the hashmap. In the end, if the hashmap is empty, the string are anagrams, otherwise, they are not.

##### Steps:

1. Create an empty hashmap.
2. Loop over the first string.
	1. If current letter is not in the hashmap, then add it with value 1, if it is, then increase its value.
3. Loop over the second string.
	1. If current letter is not in the hashmap, return false.
	2. Otherwise, decrement value for the letter.
		1. If the value reached 0, remove the key
4. Out of the loop, if hashmap is empty, return true, otherwise false.


### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        letter_count = {}

        # fill letter count with the first string chars
        for c in s:
            if c in letter_count:
                letter_count[c] += 1
            else:
                letter_count[c] = 1
        
        # depopulate hm with the second string chars
        for c in t:
            if c in letter_count:
                letter_count[c] -= 1
                if letter_count[c] == 0:
                    letter_count.pop(c)
            else:
                return False
        return letter_count == {}
```
