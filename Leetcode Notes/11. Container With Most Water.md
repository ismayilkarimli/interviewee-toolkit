# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #Arrays #TwoPointers 
Hint: Area can only be as big as its smallest side

### Explanation:
Declare two pointers to track left and right sides of the container. Then, calculate the area at each step and if current area is greater than the maximum, then replace maximum area with the new one. Advance the pointer which is pointing to the smaller side

##### Steps:

1. `l, r = 0, len(height) - 1`
2. `while l < r`
	1. `area = (l - r) * min(height[l], height[r])`
	2. `max_area = max(max_area, area)`
	3. Advance pointer with smaller height
3. `return max_area`

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = -1

        while l < r:
            w = r - l
            h = min(height[l], height[r])
            max_area = max(max_area, w * h)
            
            # since the limiting size of the area is the smaller stick
            # advance the pointer which is smaller
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        return max_area
```
