# [101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #Tree #DFS #BFS 
Hint: Tree is not mirror if values of left and right of each branch don't match.

### Explanation:
The problem is very close to `100. Same Tree` can be solved using BFS or DFS in a similar way. The idea is to check if both nodes exist and then if yes, their values match. If yes, then continue the iteration by comparing left's left with right's right and left's right with right's left in the next iterations. 

### Code (DFS):

```python
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:  
        def dfs(node_left, node_right):
            # if either node is null, then end of the root
            if not node_left and not node_right:
                return True

            # if only one node is null, then one side reached end while the other hasn't
            if not node_left or not node_right:
                return False
            
            # compare values
            if node_left.val != node_right.val:
                return False
            
            # dfs both sides
            return dfs(node_left.left, node_right.right) and dfs(node_left.right, node_right.left)
                    
        return dfs(root, root)
```

### Code (BFS):

```python
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:  
        q = deque([(root, root)])

        while q:
            node_left, node_right = q.popleft()

            # end of the tree reached for both branches
            if not node_left and not node_right:
                continue
            
            # only one branch reached the end
            if not node_left or not node_right:
                return False
            
            # values don't match
            if node_left.val != node_right.val:
                return False
            
            # add left's left and right's right and left's right and right's left to be compared
            q.append((node_left.left, node_right.right))
            q.append((node_left.right, node_right.left))
        return True
```
