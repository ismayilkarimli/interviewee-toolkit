# [Problem Title](https://leetcode.com/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #Arrays 

### Explanation:
Sort the given meeting array by the start time. Then start iterating from the 1st index, and compare the start value of the current interval to the end time of the previous interval. If they overlap, return false. If the loop terminates, then return true.

##### Steps:
1. `intervals.sort(key = lambda i : i.start)` sort intervals by start values
2. `for i in range(1, len(intervals)):` iterate over the intervals from index `1`
3. `i1 = intervals[i - 1] i2 = intervals[i]` take current and previous interval
4. `if i1.end > i2.start` check if there's an overlap
5. `return True` if the loop terminates
### Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # sort the given intervals by their start values
        intervals.sort(key = lambda i : i.start)

        # iterate through intervals 1 to n
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            i1 = intervals[i - 1]
            i2 = intervals[i]

            if i1.end > i2.start:
                return False
        return True
```
