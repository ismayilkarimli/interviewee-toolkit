# [108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)

Topic: #Tree #BinaryTree 
Hint: middle element is always the root. 

### Explanation:
In a nutshell, the middle element is always the root element. From the middle, the array is divided into two parts left and right sub-trees. Middle of the left subtree is the root of the left branch and middle of the right subtree is root of the right side. Take the middle element and create a node using it. Then to determine its left and right branches, call the process recursively updating left and right pointers for each branch. This process is continued iteratively until right pointer passes the left pointer.
##### Steps:
1. Start the iterative process with initial values of `left = 0, right = len(nums) - 1`
2. Inside the recursive function, as the base case, if right passes left, then stop
3. Otherwise, calculate mid point and create a `TreeNode` using the mid value.
4. Then recursively create `root.left` and `root.right`. For the left branch, the rightmost node is `mid - 1` while for the right it's `mid + 1`
5. return the root once all the nodes have been created

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        def toBST(left, right):
            # left passed right
            if left > right:
                return None
            
            # calculate mid (root)
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            # create root node using mid
            root = TreeNode(nums[mid])

            # create children recursively
            root.left = toBST(left, mid - 1)
            root.right = toBST(mid + 1, right)
            return root
        
        # call method with initial left and right values
        return toBST(0, len(nums) - 1)
```
