# [22. Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #Backtracking #Recursion 
Hint: 

### Explanation:
The solution generates valid parentheses combinations by building strings incrementally using backtracking. Each recursive call makes two potential moves: adding an opening bracket (if `opening < n`) or adding a closing bracket (if there are spare opening brackets to match - checked via `closing < opening`). The backtracking ensures completeness by exploring all valid paths - starting with opening brackets, then gradually adding closing brackets whenever safe. The approach works because it enforces two key rules: never allowing more `closing` than `opening` brackets at any point, and requiring exactly `n` pairs in the final string. The function terminates and saves a `combination` to the `res` list once it has successfully placed `n` opening and `n` closing brackets, guaranteeing a valid string.

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        res = []

        def backtrack(opening, closing, combination):
            if opening == closing == n:
                res.append("".join(combination))
                return
            if opening < n:
                backtrack(opening + 1, closing, combination + "(")
            if closing < opening:
                backtrack(opening, closing + 1, combination + ")")
        
        backtrack(0, 0, "")
        return res
        
```
