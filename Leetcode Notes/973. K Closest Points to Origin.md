# [973. K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #Heap
Hint: min-heap is a heap data structure where elements are sorted in ascending way

### Explanation:
The list solution to the problem has time complexity of `O(n log(n))`. However, this solution could be optimized by using min-heap, which would have time complexity of `O(k log(n))` where `k` is the number of required elements to find. First start by calculating distance from each point to the origin and adding them to the list like `[dist, x, y]`. This is because by default, python will sort min-heap using the first index of the list. Keep in mind that, it is not necessary to compute `sqrt` of the distance, since, for example, `sqrt(8) < sqrt(10)` because `8 < 10`. Once all distances are computed, turn the list into a heap using `heapq.heapify(minHeap)`. After that, iterate while `k` elements isn't reached, pop elements from the heap, and append coordinates to the result.

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        minHeap = []

        for x, y in points:
            # don't really need sqrt
            dist = (x ** 2) + (y ** 2)

            # python will sort minHeap by the first index
            minHeap.append([dist, x, y])
        
        # turn minHeap list to heap
        heapq.heapify(minHeap)

        res = []
        while k > 0:
            # pop from the heap
            dist, x, y = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            res.append([x, y])
            k -= 1
        
        return res
```
