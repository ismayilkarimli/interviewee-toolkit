# [338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #DynamicProgramming 
Hint: 

### Explanation:
The core idea is that while the number is not a power of two, then it can be represented in last power of two + (number - last power of two). For this reason, create an array that will hold the number of 1 bits in a given number, populate it with 0s initially, and initialize an offset with value 1. At each iteration starting from `1`, check if the number is a power of `2` (this can be found by multiplying last offset with 2, since the offset always is a power of two, multiplying it with 2 gives the next power of 2.). If the number is a power of two, then update the offset to the current number. At each iteration, the number of 1 bits in a given number is `1` + (number - offset). For example, 8 = 8 + 0 (the number of 1 bits in 8 + the number of 1 bits in 0), then 9 is represented by 9 = 8 + 1, in other words it only has one more 1 bit than the previous number. In a nutshell, the most significant `1` bit stays fixed while the rest of the bits are gathered from the previous computations.
### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        # array to store bit count of each number
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)

        # from which index the numbers of 0s should be taken from
        offset = 1

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # if power of 2, then it needs an extra bit for representation
            if offset * 2 == i:
                offset = i
            # 1 new bit + all bits of the number at appropriate index
            dp[i] = 1 + dp[i - offset]
        return dp
```
