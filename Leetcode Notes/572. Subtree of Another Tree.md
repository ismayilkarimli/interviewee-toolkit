# [572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #DFS #Tree 
Hint: While the tree's are not identical, recursively compare their branches

### Explanation:
The idea is the following. Traverse starting from the root and compare trees, if it's not equal then traverse left and right branches, then compare tree for both left and right branch. If either is identical, then subroot is within the tree. The edge cases are, if the subroot is null, then it's assumed to be in the tree. If the subroot is not null but the tree is null, then its not in the root. If both are valid, then check if they are the same. If yes, return true, if not compare the branches.

##### Steps:
1. Define two recursive functions `dfs` to traverse the root. `sameTree` to check if trees from the given root are identical.
2. Inside the DFS, first check if subRoot exists as the edge case, then check if the root exists.
3. Assuming both are valid, check if `subRoot` and `root` are the same from the current `root`, if yes return true
4. If not, then traverse to the left and right branches of the root using `dfs` and repeat the process for each of them. If either of them is true, then return true, otherwise false

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubtree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], subRoot: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(root):
            # subRoot is null
            if not subRoot:
                return True

            # root is null
            if not root:
                return False
            
            # trees are same
            if sameTree(root, subRoot):
                return True
            
            # trees not same but branches might be
            return dfs(root.left) or dfs(root.right)
        
        def sameTree(root1, root2):
            # both none
            if not root1 and not root2:
                return True
        
            # only one none
            if not root1 or not root2:
                return False
        
            # values different
            if root1.val != root2.val:
                return False
        
            return sameTree(root1.left, root2.left) and sameTree(root1.right, root2.right)
        
        return dfs(root)
```
