Hint: Use doubly Linked List to track MRU and LRU

### Explanation:
The idea is to use HashMap as the cache store where key is the given key but the value will be stored in the Doubly LinkedList, and hashmap's value will be a reference to the node in the list. To do so, firstly, create a Node class for a Doubly Linked List. Then when the LRU cache is initialized, we need the capacity, hashmap, as well as initial dummy nodes left and right that point to each other. Left and Right nodes will help to track LRU and MRU respectively. The main part of the solution are handling removals and insertions to the cache. Whenever, value is inserted, read, or updated it needs to be marked as the MRU. There's no need to update LRU because as MRU is updated, LRU updates happen as a byproduct. To insert a value as the MRU, it needs to be inserted between the right's previous node and right. Take the current previous node and right node. Assign them to the previous and next pointers of the current node. Update next pointer of the previous node and previous pointer of the next node. Removal process involves modifying the next and previous pointer of the node's to the left and right of the current node. To do so, get the nodes to the left and right to the current node and make them point to each other as next and previous instead, effectively, bypassing the current node.

### Code:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key, val):
        # each node has k-v pair
        self.key, self.val = key, val
        self.prev, self.next = None, None

class LRUCache:

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = {}
        
        # dummy left and right nodes
        self.left, self.right = Node(0, 0), Node(0, 0)

        # left -> LRU, right -> MRU
        self.left.next = self.right
        self.right.prev = self.left

    # remove from left
    def remove(self, node):
        # get prev and next of to-be-removed node
        prev, nxt = node.prev, node.next

        # modify node's prev and next to bypass current node, by pointing to each other instead
        prev.next, nxt.prev = nxt, prev
    
    # insert to right
    def insert(self, node):
        # get right and prev pointers
        prev, nxt = self.right.prev, self.right
        
        # put MRU between previous MRU and rightmost node
        prev.next, nxt.prev = node, node

        # new MRU prev is previous MRU and next is rightmost node
        node.prev, node.next = prev, nxt

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key not in self.cache:
            return -1

        # make the node MRU
        self.remove(self.cache[key])
        self.insert(self.cache[key])
        return self.cache[key].val
        
    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        # remove node from the list if its there
        if key in self.cache:
            # remove node for current pair
            self.remove(self.cache[key])
        
        # update/insert existing key with a reference to the node
        self.cache[key] = Node(key, value)

        # insert node as MRU
        self.insert(self.cache[key])

        # capacity exceeded, remove LRU
        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            # remove LRU from list and map
            lru = self.left.next
            self.remove(lru)

            # delete LRU from cache
            self.cache.pop(lru.key)

```
