# [110. Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/description/)  

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #BinaryTree #DFS #Recursion 

###### Short Description:
Given a binary tree, determine if its height-balanced
### Explanation:
For a tree to be balanced, all of its subtrees need to be balanced as well. For an optimal solution, therefore, it is needed to traverse as deep as possible, then come back up. A tree is balanced if the depth difference between its left and right branches is at most 1. If the root is empty, then its balanced and has a height of 0. If the height is not 0, then traverse left and right branches by recursively calling the inner method. After the recursive calls, check if the tree is balanced by verifying both left and right branches are balanced and the absolute value of the difference between their branches is less than or equal to 1. Because of cases where depth of left is 0 but right is 2. Without absolute difference, this would result in -2 which is less than 1 but the tree is unbalanced. At the end, the inner method should return balanced and the depth. Depth is calculated by 1 + maximum of left and right depths. Adding 1 is needed since, the first node is already height 1.
##### Steps:

1. Since the given method returns only boolean but we need depth of the tree as well, we create an inner method `dfs` that takes a root and returns `depth` of the tree or `-1` if tree is unbalanced.
2. Inside the inner method, first to determine if we have reached the end of a given root, we need a base case that checks if the given root is empty or not. Empty root is balanced and has a height of 0.
3. If the root is not empty, then left and right subtrees are traversed by recursively calling the `dfs`.
4. Root is considered to be balanced if left tree is balanced, right tree is balanced, and the absolute depth difference between children is at most 1. 
5. At the end, the method should return balanced and maximum depth of left and right trees + 1.
6. The outer method should call the recursive inner `dfs` method by passing initial root and returning whether or not its height is `-1`

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                # empty root has height 0 and is balanced
                return 0

            # traverse left and right subtrees
            left_height = dfs(root.left)
            right_height = dfs(root.right)

            # if any of the subtrees is unbalanced, then the tree is unbalanced
            if left_height == -1 or right_height == -1:
                return -1

            # if at any point tree is unbalanced, return -1
            if abs(left_height - right_height) > 1:
                return -1
            
            # add 1 to the height of the tree
            return 1 + max(left_height, right_height)

        return dfs(root) != -1
```
