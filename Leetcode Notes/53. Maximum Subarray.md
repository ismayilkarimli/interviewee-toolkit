# [53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #SlidingWindow #Arrays 
Hint: If the sum until current point is negative, restart from the current number

### Explanation:
Two variables are needed to track the maximum sum and current sum. Then, go through each number in the array updating `curSum`. If at any point, `curSum` becomes negative, it means the sum until the current point is decreasing the overall value of the subarray, therefore, set current sum to `0` to re-start the calculation from the current point. At the end of each iteration, update `maxSum` if needed.

##### Steps:
1. `maxSum, curSum = nums[0], 0`
2. `for num in nums`
	1. `if curSum < 0` - sum of numbers until this point are negative, so reset `curSum = 0`
	2. `curSum += num`
	3. `maxSum = max(maxSum, curSum)` 
3. `return maxSum`


### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxSum, curSum = nums[0], 0

        for num in nums:
            # if prefix until this point is negative
            # then don't consider sum until current point
            if curSum < 0:
                curSum = 0
            curSum += num

            # update max sum
            maxSum = max(maxSum, curSum)
        return maxSum
```
