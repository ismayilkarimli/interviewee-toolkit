# [150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #Stack 

### Explanation:
In Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), the operators follow the operands. Meaning, there's nothing to do until an operator is encountered. For this reason, while the character is not an operator, push the numbers into a stack. Once an operator is encountered, pop the top two digits from the stack, apply operator to them, then push the result back into the stack. In the end, whatever value is on top the stack is the result of the RPN operation

##### Steps:
1. `numbers = []` to hold numbers
2. Go through each token
	1. If token is a number, put it to the numbers stack
	2. Otherwise, pop the topmost two numbers from the stack and evaluate
3. Once the loop is over, pop the final and only element from the stack

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        # stack to hold numbers
        numbers = []

        for t in tokens:
            # if token t is a number or operator
            if t == "+":
                a = numbers.pop()
                b = numbers.pop()
                numbers.append(b + a)
            elif t == "-":
                a = numbers.pop()
                b = numbers.pop()
                numbers.append(b - a)
            elif t  == "*":
                a = numbers.pop()
                b = numbers.pop()
                numbers.append(b * a)
            elif t == "/":
                a = numbers.pop()
                b = numbers.pop()
                numbers.append(int(b / a))
            else:
                # put number in the stack
                numbers.append(int(t))

        return numbers.pop()
```
