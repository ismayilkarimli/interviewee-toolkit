Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #Stack 
Hint: Store minimum after each addition, that way you have minimum at every step

### Explanation:
Initialize two stacks. One stack will store all the values, the other one will store minimum at every step. When a new value is added to the stack, compare that value with the previous minimum, and append the minimum between them to the minimum stack. When popping, pop elements from both stacks.

### Code:

```python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.mins = []
        

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.stack.append(val)
        
        if self.mins:
            # determine minimum after latest addition
            val = min(val, self.mins[-1])
        self.mins.append(val)
        

    def pop(self) -> None:
        self.stack.pop()
        self.mins.pop()
        

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]
        

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.mins[-1]
```
