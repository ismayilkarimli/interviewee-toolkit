# [46. Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #DFS #Backtracking

### Explanation:
Start a DFS with an empty list. Inside the DFS process, for every number in the `nums`, insert it to the list provided in the argument if it's already not in it. Then, call the DFS function again, this time with the number added. As the base case, if the length of the list is same as `nums`, then append the list to the result and return.
##### Steps:
1. `def dfs(curr):`
	1. `if len(curr) == len(nums): res.append(curr) return` base case
	2. `for num in nums:` permutation not yet computed, take number from `nums`
	3. `if num not in curr: dfs(curr + [nums])` append the number to the current list and call DFS recursively
2. `dfs([])` start DFS with an empty list
3. `return result`

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        def dfs(curr):
            # append current to the result once all permutation is computed
            if len(curr) == len(nums):
                res.append(curr)
                return

            # permutation not computed yet, add another number
            for num in nums:
                # the given numbers are distinct, avoid duplication
                if num not in curr:
                    # append number to the current permutation (creates a new list)
                    dfs(curr + [num])
        dfs([])
        return res
```
