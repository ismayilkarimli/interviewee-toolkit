# [234. Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #TwoPointers #LinkedList 
Hint: Go to the middle of the list. Reverse the list from the middle, then compare lists.

### Explanation:
In a nutshell the solution involves going to the middle of the list, then reversing the list from the middle, effectively creating a pathway from the right end of the list to the middle of it. Then, start from the both ends and compare values, if there's an inequality, return false. Otherwise, in the end, return true.
##### Steps:
1. Find the middle of the list
2. Start reversing the list from the middle element until the end
3. Traverse the list from both ends comparing equality of the nodes

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow, fast = head, head

        # find middle
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # slow is now mid, reverse pointer from the middle
        prev = None
        while slow:
            temp = slow.next
            slow.next = prev
            prev = slow
            slow = temp
        
        # traverse list from both sides using L and R
        left, right = head, prev
        while left and right:
            if left.val != right.val:
                return False
            left = left.next
            right = right.next

        return True
```
