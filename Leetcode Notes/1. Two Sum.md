# [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Difficulty:  #Easy 
Topic:  #HashMap
Hint: Store difference between target and current value and its index in a hashmap.

###### Short description:
Given an array, find the index of two indices that add up to a given target.
### Explanation:

Create an empty hashmap. Iterate over the given array and get the number and its index. Calculate the difference between target and current number. If the difference exists in the hashmap, it means, we already have found the number that when subtracted from the target results in the current number. Therefore, return the current index and the value of key from the hashmap. 

##### Steps:

1. Create an empty hashmap to store `key: target - currentNumber, value: currentNumber index`.
2. Iterate over the given array.
3. Check if the current number exists in the hashmap.
4. If it does, return value associated with the key from the hashmap and current index.
5. If not, then store `map[target - currentNumber] = currentIndex`

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        differences = {}
        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num in differences:
                return [differences[num], index]
            differences[target - num] = index
```
