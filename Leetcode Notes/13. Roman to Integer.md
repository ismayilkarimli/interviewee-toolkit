# [Problem Title](https://leetcode.com/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #HashMap 

### Explanation:
Define a map of roman numerals to integers. Go through each element in the given string. In case the character after the current character is greater than the current one, then it should be subtracted from the result (think `IV` or `IX`). Otherwise, it should be added to the result (think `XI`). Once the loop is over return the result.
##### Steps:
1. Define hashmap linking roman numbers to integers
2. Go through each character in the given string
3. If there's a character after the current character and its greater than the current one, then subtract current character from the result
4. Otherwise, add it to the result

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman = {
            'I': 1,
            'V': 5,
            'X': 10,
            'L': 50,
            'C': 100,
            'D': 500,
            'M': 1000
        }

        res = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            # check if proceeding character is less or greater than current number
            if (i + 1) < len(s) and roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i + 1]]:
                # current character less than the next character
                res -= roman[s[i]]
            else:
                res += roman[s[i]]
        return res
```
