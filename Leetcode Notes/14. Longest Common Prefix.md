# [14. Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #Strings 
Hint: Iterate through any string in the given list, take a character at the given iteration, then iterate through all strings, if character in bounds and matches for every string add it to result.

### Explanation:
Basically, iterate through the characters of any string in the list, take the character at each iteration `i`, then start going through each string in the list in a nested loop. If `i` is within the bounds for a string and characters match, then add it to the result. Otherwise, the `i` either is out of bounds for some string or the prefix stopped matching, return result.
##### Steps:
1. Iterate through the range of some string in the list
2. Take the character at current iteration
3. Start going through each string, and check if the current iteration in bounds and if yes, then if character at current iteration match for both strings. If for any string one of these conditions is wrong, then return the result
4. Otherwise, append the character to the prefix string

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        res = ''

        for i in range(len(strs[0])):
            # char at i from the first string
            char = strs[0][i]

            for s in strs:
                # i is oob for some string s or prefix doesn't match
                if i == len(s) or s[i] != char:
                    return res
            # i in bounds for all strings and prefix matched, add to result
            res += char
        return res
```
