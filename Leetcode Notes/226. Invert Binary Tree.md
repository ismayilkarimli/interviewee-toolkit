# [226. Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)

Difficulty:  #Easy 
Topic: #BinaryTree #Recursion 
Hint: Swap branches, call method recursively on left and right branches.

###### Short description:
Given a root of the binary tree, invert the tree and return its root.

### Explanation:

The solution is achieved via recursion. Swap the topmost left and right branches, then swap their children and continue until the end of the tree is reached, at which point the root should be returned.

##### Steps:

1. The base case is if the root is empty, then return.
2. Otherwise, swap left and right branches.
3. Call method recursively on the left branch.
4. Call method recursively on the right branch.
5. Return root after recursive calls.


### Code:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return

        # swap branches
        temp = root.left
        root.left = root.right
        root.right = temp

        # invert both branches
        self.invertTree(root.left)
        self.invertTree(root.right)

        # return node after inversions
        return root
```
