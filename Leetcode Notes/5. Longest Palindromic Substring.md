# [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #TwoPointers 
Hint: start from a center character, then expand outwards finding odd and even palindromes 

### Explanation:
The base idea is to use every letter as the starting center of a palindrome. Then, the pointers are moved from the center to outwards finding new palindromes. First, palindromes of odd length are found and maximum palindromic substring is updated. Once the pointers go out of bounds, they are reset to search for palindromes of even length using the same logic.

##### Steps:
1. `max_sub = ""` keeps track of the longest palindrome
2. `for i in range(len(s)):` outer loop which specifies the center of the palindrome
	1. `l, r = i, i` for finding palindromes of odd length, left and right should start from the same starting point
	2. `while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]` while they're within bounds and match
		1. `max_sub = s[l:r+1] if len(s[l:r+1]) > len(max_sub) else max_sub` update maximum substring and advance the pointers
	3. `l, r = i, i + 1` after finding the odd palindromes, reset left and right to find palindromes of even length
		1. The `while` loop logic is the same as for odd palindromes
3. `return max_sub` once the outer loop terminates

### Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        max_sub = ""

        for i in range(len(s)):
            # i -> starting center

            # left and right to find palindromes of odd length from center i
            l, r = i, i
            
            # while left and right are within bounds
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                # there's match
                max_sub = s[l:r+1] if len(s[l:r+1]) > len(max_sub) else max_sub
                l -= 1
                r += 1

            # left and right to find palindromes of even length from center i
            l, r = i, i + 1

            # while left and right are within bounds
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                # there's match
                max_sub = s[l:r+1] if len(s[l:r+1]) > len(max_sub) else max_sub
                l -= 1
                r += 1
            
        return max_sub

```
