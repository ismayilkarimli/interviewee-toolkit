# [438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #SlidingWindow #HashMap 
Hint: 

### Explanation:
Create a hashmap that holds `letter - count` pair of the string `p`. Then create a window by going through the first `len(p)` elements of the string `s` and adding them to a hashmap. The idea is to pop window elements from the left and add elements from the right as the window progresses. Start a loop from the index `len(p)` of the string `s` and loop until the end of the string. Inside the loop, compare the hashmaps, if there's equality, then add the current start pointer to the result list. Then, slide the window to the right by increasing the next element count in the hashmap window and reducing the element count of the current element. If the count hits `0`, then remove that element from the hashmap window. Increment the start pointer. Once the loop terminates, compare the hashmaps for the last time to check if the window created from the last start is anagram or not, if yes, add the start value to the result list.
##### Steps:
1. `if len(p) > len(s): return []` edge case -> can't construct an anagram if `p` is greater than `s`
2. `hmP, hmS = {}, {}` hashmap for both strings
3. `for l in p: hmP[l] = hmP.get(l, 0) + 1` populate `p` hashmap with `letter - count` pairs
4. `for i in range(len(p)): hmS[s[i]] = hmS.get(s[i], 0) + 1` populate initial window of size `len(p)` using the elements from `s`
5. `res = [] start = 0` initialize result list and start index prior to looping
6. `for i in range(len(p), len(s)):` start looping from `len(p)` index of string `s`
	1. compare `hmP and hmS`, if equal, add start to the result list
	2. Then, add current `s[i]` to the window, and reduce count of `s[start]` from the window, in case it reaches `0`, then remove it
	3. `start += 1` increase the start index
7. Once the loop is over, compare hashmaps for the final time, if equal, then add `start` to the result list
8. `return res`

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        # can't construct an anagram
        if len(p) > len(s): return []

        hmP, hmS = {}, {}

        # populate hm with letters of p
        for l in p:
            hmP[l] = hmP.get(l, 0) + 1
            
        # create the initial window
        # create window of size p with letters from s
        for i in range(len(p)):
            hmS[s[i]] = hmS.get(s[i], 0) + 1

        res = []
        start = 0

        # start looping from len(p) since already iterated above
        for i in range(len(p), len(s)):
            # check if anagram
            if hmP == hmS:
                res.append(start)
            
            # slide window to the right
            hmS[s[i]] = hmS.get(s[i], 0) + 1
            hmS[s[start]] -= 1

            # letter count is 0, pop from the hashmap
            if hmS[s[start]] == 0:
                hmS.pop(s[start])
            
            # increment start
            start += 1
        
        if hmS == hmP:
            res.append(start)
        
        return res
```
