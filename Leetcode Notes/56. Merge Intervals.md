# [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

Difficulty: Medium
Topic: Arrays
Hint: Intervals overlap, if the start of current interval is less than or equal to the ending of the last interval in a list sorted by interval start times
### Explanation:
First, sort the intervals by their start times to make sure that intervals come in an ascending order. Then, for each interval that is not the first interval, compare its start time with the end time of the last interval, if its less than or equal, then intervals should be merged. Replace the ending of the interval with the `max` ending time of the either of the intervals. If the intervals don't overlap, just add it to the result list.

##### Steps:
1. Sort intervals by start time `intervals.sort(key = lambda i : i[0])`
2. `for interval in intervals`
	1. `if not res`, then add it means this is the first interval, `res.append(interval)`
	2. `else` 
		1. `if` end of the last interval is  greater than or equal to current interval, then `pop` last interval and replace it with modified one
		2. `else` intervals don't overlap, `res.append(interval)`

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        
        # sort array by interval starts
        intervals.sort(key = lambda i : i[0])

        for interval in intervals:
            if res == []:
                res.append(interval)
            else:
                last_interval_s, last_interval_e = res[-1]
                interval_s, interval_e = interval
                if last_interval_e >= interval_s:
                    res.pop()
                    res.append([last_interval_s, max(last_interval_e, interval_e)])
                else:
                    res.append(interval)
        return res

```
