# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: #LinkedList #TwoPointers 
Hint: If the distance between the pointers is `n - 1`, then when the right pointer exits, left pointer will be at a point one before the target node

### Explanation:
The solution uses two pointers and the goal is to make sure that when one pointer finishes the list, the other will be at a point before the target node so it can skip it. To do this, start the left node at node `head - 1`. Do this by initializing a dummy node with value 0 and next pointer of `head`. Set left pointer to dummy node, while right pointer to `head`. Then, while `n > 0`, advance the right pointer. Then, while right pointer is still valid, advance both pointers. When the right pointer exits, then the left one will be at `n - 1`. Skip the target pointer by setting next value of the left pointer to `left.next.next`. In the end, return `dummy.next` to return the LinkedList from the beginning

##### Steps:
1. `dummy = ListNode(0, head)` dummy node that comes before the `head`
2. `left, right = dummy, head` two pointers
3. advance right pointer, `while n > 0`
4. `while right`, advance both pointers
5. `left.next = left.next.next` skip the target node
6. `return dummy.next`
### Code:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # dummy node initialized a point before head 
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)

        # start left pointer one step before to right
        left, right = dummy, head
        

        # make distance between pointers n
        while n > 0:
            right = right.next
            n -= 1
        
        # advance while right hasn't exited
        while right:
            right = right.next
            left = left.next
        
        # right has exited, next node for left is the target node
        left.next = left.next.next

        return dummy.next
```
