Topic: 
Hint: missing number can be found by subtracting actual sum from expected sum

### Explanation:
Find the expected sum. It can be found using mathematical formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. Then calculate the actual sum. The difference between them is the missing number.

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
        n_sum = sum(nums)
        return expected_sum - n_sum

```
