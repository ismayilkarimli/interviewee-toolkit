# [67. Add Binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #Strings

### Explanation:
Adding binaries works with this principle: take the rightmost bits from each binary, sum them, in case they go over 0 or 1, add the surplus to carry. In the next iterations, if carry is non-zero add it as well. Once all bits have been added, in the end if carry is greater than 0, append 1 to the left of the result.
##### Steps:
1. Reverse given binary strings
2. traverse while one of the strings hasn't finished
3. Take `i` bit from each string, in case `i` is out of bounds, then take 0
4. sum both bits and the carry
5. bit will always be `total % 2`, while carry will be `total // 2`
6. Append the new bit to the result
7. After the loop terminates, append `1` to the result from the left side, in case carry is non-zero

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        # reverse binary strings
        a, b = a[::-1], b[::-1]
        carry = 0
        res = ""

        for i in range(max(len(a), len(b))):
            # convert char to int
            bitA = int(a[i]) if i < len(a) else 0
            bitB = int(b[i]) if i < len(b) else 0

            # sum of current bits and carry
            total = bitA + bitB + carry

            # since carry can go over 0 or 1 mod it with 2
            bit = str(total % 2)
            res = bit + res

            # update carry
            carry = total // 2
        
        # carry greater than 0 after sum
        if carry:
            res = "1" + res
        
        return res
```
