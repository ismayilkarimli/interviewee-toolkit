# [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #TwoPointers 
Hint: Left pointer should keep track of where the next non-zero number should be placed, right pointer should find the next non-zero.

### Explanation:
Another way to think of the problem statement is "move non-zero elements to the left of the array." The idea is to use two pointers - left pointer to keep track of where the next non-zero number should be placed at, while the right pointer should iterate the list to find the next non-zero number. Once a non-zero number is found, swap the values at the pointers.

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # which index the next number should be shifted to
        l = 0

        # iterate right pointer
        for r in range(len(nums)):
            # number is not 0, move it to the left
            if nums[r] != 0:
                # swap pointer numbers
                temp = nums[l]
                nums[l] = nums[r]
                nums[r] = temp
                l += 1
```
