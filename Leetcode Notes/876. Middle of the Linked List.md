# [876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #LinkedList #SlowAndFast
Hint: When a fast pointer reaches the end, slow pointer will be in the middle

### Explanation:
Start two pointers fast and slow from the same starting point. Loop while fast pointer has not reached the end. Inside the loop, advance fast pointer two steps while slow pointer a single step. Once the loop is terminated, slow pointer will be in the middle
### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # slow and fast pointers start at the same start
        slow, fast = head, head

        # while fast node has not reached the end
        while fast and fast.next:
            # slow advances 1 step
            slow = slow.next

            # fast advances 2 steps
            fast = fast.next.next

        # when fast reaches the end, slow will be in the middle
        return slow
```
