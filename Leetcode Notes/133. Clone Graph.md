Hint: Create a hashmap to keep link between old node and its new copy

### Explanation:
The main principle is to store the current node as the key in a hashmap, then its copy as the value. The graph can be iterated using DFS or BFS. The fundamental idea for both ways is the same. First, check that node is not `null`, then create the hashmap. Then, going through the graph from the first node. If node is already in the hashmap, then return it immediately. Otherwise, create a copy of it and store the copy as a value and current node as the key. Iterate the neighbors of the current node, and call `dfs` on them to copy them as well. Then, append the results to the copied node's neighbor list. Finally return the copy node after it has been copied alongside its neighbors. 
##### Steps:
1. Edge case: return if the given node is null
2. `oldToNew = {}` to store link between a node and its copy
3. `def dfs(node)`
	1. `if node in oldToNew:` node has already been explored, `return oldToNew[node]`
	2. `copy = Node(node.val)` create a copy node and link it to the current node in the hashmap `oldToNew[node] = copy`
	3. `for neighbor in node.neighbors:` traverse the neighbors of the current node
		1. `oldToNew[node].neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))` call `dfs` on each neighbor to make a copy of it as well, then append the copy to the current node's copy's neighbor list
	4. `return copy` once the node and its neighbors have been copied
4. `dfs(node)` to start the `dfs` process
5. `return dfs(node)` or `return oldToNew[node]`

### Code (DFS):

```python
from typing import Optional
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
        if not node:
            return None
            
        # hm to store mapping of existing node to copy node
        oldToNew = {}

        def dfs(node):
            # if node has already been copied
            if node in oldToNew:
                return oldToNew[node]
            
            # create copy
            copy = Node(node.val)
            oldToNew[node] = copy

            # create copy of neighbors
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:

				# dfs on neighbors and append result to neighbors of the copy
                oldToNew[node].neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))

			# node has been copied along with its neighbors, return
            return copy
            
        
        dfs(node)
        return oldToNew[node]
```

### Code (BFS):

```python
from typing import Optional
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
        if not node:
            return node
    
        # Map to hold original nodes to their clones
        old_to_new = {}
    
        # Initialize BFS with the first node
        queue = deque([node])

        # Create a clone for the first node
        old_to_new[node] = Node(node.val)
    
        while queue:
            # Process the current node
            current = queue.popleft()
        
            # Process all neighbors
            for neighbor in current.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in old_to_new:
                    # Clone the neighbor
                    old_to_new[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val)

                    # Add it to the queue to process its neighbors
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                    
                # Link the clone of the current node to the clone of the neighbor
                old_to_new[current].neighbors.append(old_to_new[neighbor])
    
        # Return the clone of the original input node
        return old_to_new[node]

```
