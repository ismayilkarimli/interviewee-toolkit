# [2592. Maximize Greatness of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-greatness-of-an-array/)

Difficulty: #Medium
Topic: #TwoPointers 
Hint: Sort the array, then for each smaller number search for a larger number. Count all such occurrences

### Explanation:
The problem requires to count the elements that have an element in the array that is greater than itself. For example, for the input `[1,3,5,2,1,3,1]`, has the greatness of 4 - `(2 > 1)`, `(3 > 1)`, `(3 > 1)`, `(5 > 2)`. The goal is basically to find and count such pairs. For this, two pointers in a sorted array can be used. Basically, the left array will keep track of the current smallest number while the right pointer will search for its pair, once a pair is found, left pointer is shifted to find pair for the other number. Since the array is sorted, it is guaranteed that the numbers to the left of the current right pointer are smaller than the number at the current left pointer. In the end, the number of times left pointer was shifted is the answer
##### Steps:
1. sort the array
2. set left pointer to the begging
3. right pointer always moves to the right
4. if the number at right is greater than the one at left, it means a number that is greater than the current minimum exists, advance the left
5. return the number of left shifts at the end
### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def maximizeGreatness(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # sort the array so larger elements are to the right
        nums.sort()

        # keep track of the lowest number in nums
        left = 0
    
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            # found a larger number than the current one
            if nums[right] > nums[left]:
                # search for a larger number than the second smallest number
                left += 1
    
        return left
```
