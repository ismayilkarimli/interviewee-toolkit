# 733. Flood Fill

Difficulty: #Easy  
Topic: #Array #Matrix #Recursion  
Hint: Write a recursive function that paints the pixel if it's the correct color, then recursively calls the neighboring cells.

###### Short Description:
In the question, an image is given that is represented by `m x n` where each cell represents a pixel
Other given parameters are:

- `sr` and `sc` for starting row and column.

* `color` for representing the new color of cells

### Explanation:

Color the given cell at `sr`,`sc` then explore the neighboring cells and color them if needed.

##### Steps:

1. first we need to store the initial color, so that in future cells, we can determine if the cell shares the same color as the first cell before being colored.
2. Then, we create a method (let's say `fill`) that will be called recursively to color the whole image matrix, the parameters of this method are the same as the `floodFill` method.
3. Inside `fill`, first check if the given `sr` and `sc` are within the array bounds, if not `return`.
4. Then, to prevent cases where the cell color and new color are the same, a check is needed to see cell and new color are equal, if yes it means the cell has already been colored, so `return`.
5. Color the tile
6. Explore the neighbors in all 4 directions by recursively calling the `fill` function.
7. Inside the caller `floodFill` method, make a call to the `fill` method
8. Finally, we need to `return` the resulting image

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # initial color which is being colored over
        start_color = image[sr][sc]

        def fill(image, sr, sc, color):
            # out of bounds
            if sr < 0 or sr >= len(image) or sc < 0 or sc >= len(image[0]):
                return

            # current tile's color differs from the original tile
            if image[sr][sc] != start_color:
                return

            # tile already been colored
            if image[sr][sc] == color:
                return

            # color the tile
            image[sr][sc] = color

            # explore neighbors
            fill(image, sr - 1, sc, color)
            fill(image, sr + 1, sc, color)
            fill(image, sr, sc - 1, color)
            fill(image, sr, sc + 1, color)

        fill(image, sr, sc, color)
        return image
```
