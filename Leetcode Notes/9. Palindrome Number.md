# [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: 
Hint: store original number, then compare the reversed number with the original

### Explanation:
First store the original number in some variable as the original variable will be modified. Then while the number is greater than `0`, take its last digit and add it to a reversed number. In the end compare reversed number and the variable that stored the original number.
##### Steps:
1. `number, reverse = x, 0` store copy and define reverse number
2. `while x > 0` while there's still digits in the given number
	1. take its last digit and add it to the reversed. Before adding multiply the `reverse` with `10`
	2. remove the last digit from the number
3. return whether reverse and copy are equal

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        # store copy of the number
        number = x
        reverse = 0

        while x > 0:
            
            # get last number and add it to the reverse
            reverse = reverse * 10 + x % 10

            # remove last number from x
            x //= 10
        
        return reverse == number
```
