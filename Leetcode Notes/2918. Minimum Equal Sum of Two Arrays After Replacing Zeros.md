# [2918. Minimum Equal Sum of Two Arrays After Replacing Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-equal-sum-of-two-arrays-after-replacing-zeros/)

Difficulty: #Medium 
Topic: 
Hint: The minimum sum is, largest_sum + zero_count. This solution can only be not satisfied if the other side has no 0 values to replace with some other positive integer

### Explanation:
Go through each array, finding its sum and the number of 0s it has. Then, there are 3 possibilities, either the sum of sides and the count of zeros in each side is equal, right side is greater, or left side is greater. If the sides are equal, then the minimum obtainable sum is `sum + zero_count` since the minimum value each 0 can be replaced with is 1. If the one array is greater, then the minimum sum is the sum of that array and its zero count, again since the minimum number a 0 can be replaced with is 1. However, one case that should be kept in mind, is that the minimum sum cannot be achieved by the smaller side if it has no 0s to replace, since in that case the sum can't be increased to reach the greater side.
##### Steps:
1. Calculate sum of the each array and count its zeros
2. Check if sums + zeros are equal, if yes, then the minimum sum is sum + zeros
3. If one side is greater, if the smaller side has no 0s, then the minimum sum can't be computed, return `-1`, otherwise, the minimum sum is sum of the greater side and its zero count
### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def minSum(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        sum_first, zeros_first = 0, 0
        sum_second, zeros_second = 0, 0

        for num in nums1:
            sum_first += num
            if num == 0:
                zeros_first += 1

        for num in nums2:
            sum_second += num
            if num == 0:
                zeros_second += 1
        
        # if both sides sum to the same sum + x, then all x = 1 for the minimum sum
        if sum_first + zeros_first  == sum_second + zeros_second:
            return sum_first + zeros_first
        
        # right side greater than the left
        if sum_first + zeros_first  > sum_second + zeros_second:
            # second can't be increased
            if zeros_second == 0:
                return -1
            return sum_first + zeros_first
        # left side greater than the right
        else:
            # first can't be increased
            if zeros_first == 0:
                return -1
            return sum_second + zeros_second
        
```
