# [100. Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #BFS #DFS  #Tree
Hint: The tree is not equal if only one node is `null` or the values are different. Otherwise, continue iterating the trees and comparing

### Explanation:
The problem can be solved with BFS or DFS. In both cases, it involves checking whether both nodes are valid, if yes whether their values are equal. If these conditions satisfy, then continue the iteration. The only difference between the implementations is when both nodes are `null`. Since DFS is recursive, when both nodes are `null`, they are equal as the base case. In BFS, if both are none, then the iteration is skipped since it'll not produce a `False` value and `null` nodes won't have a left or right

### Code (BFS):

```python
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        queue = deque([(p, q)])

        while queue:
            node_p, node_q = queue.popleft()

            if not node_p and not node_q:
                continue
            
            if not node_p or not node_q:
                return False
            
            if node_p.val != node_q.val:
                return False

            queue.append((node_p.left, node_q.left))
            queue.append((node_p.right, node_q.right))
        return True
```

### Code (DFS):

```python
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        # both are null
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        
        # only one is null
        if not p or not q:
            return False
        
        # values are different
        if p.val != q.val:
            return False
        
        # continue iteration
        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        
```
