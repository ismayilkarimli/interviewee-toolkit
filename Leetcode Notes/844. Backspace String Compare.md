# [844. Backspace String Compare](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #TwoPointers 
Hint: Traverse strings from the end

### Explanation:
Since the pound character comes after the invalid character, start traversing the strings from the right side. This way, when pound character is seen, the subsequent character can be skipped. Start both pointers from the end of each string and start comparing valid characters. If a pound symbol is seen, then skip that character and however many subsequent characters necessary (keep the track of it using a variable). Once all characters have been skipped, return the character. This process could be done using a helper function. Start a loop and iterate while one of the pointers is within the bounds. Call the helper function for each string from the current point. The helper function should return an index instead of a character (in case index goes out of bounds). Once the index of the next valid character is returned for both strings, if both of them out of bounds, then it means, starting from the current pointers for both string, rest of the string is empty, hence they are equal. However, if only one of the indexes is inbound, then it means, the string are not equal. If both indexes are in bounds, return compare characters they are pointing to. If they are the same, then advance the pointers. Once the loop terminates, it means both strings are equal.

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        i, j = len(s) - 1, len(t) - 1

        # helper function to retrieve the next valid char from a given string
        def nextValidChar(str, index):
            # backspace counter
            backs = 0

            # from current index loop until the beginning of the string
            while index >= 0:
                if str[index] != '#' and backs == 0:
                    # when pointer is some letter and backspaces is 0, then thats a valid character
                    break
                elif str[index] == '#':
                    # in case of backspace character
                    backs += 1
                else:
                    # skipped char, reduce backspace count
                    backs -= 1
                # advance index in case of invalid character
                index -= 1
            return index
        
        while i >= 0 or j >= 0:
            i = nextValidChar(s, i)
            j = nextValidChar(t, j)

            if i < 0 and j < 0:
                # both pointers out of bounds
                return True
            if i < 0 or j < 0:
                # only one pointer out of bounds
                return False
            if s[i] != t[j]:
                # compare chars
                return False

            # advance the pointers
            i -= 1
            j -= 1

        return True
```
