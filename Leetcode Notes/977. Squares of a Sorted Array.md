# [977. Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #TwoPointers #Arrays 
Hint: Create another array, compare squares at left and right numbers and insert the bigger number to the end of the array

### Explanation:
In a nutshell, compute the square of each number at each end of the array, and insert them to the result array. Whichever number has been inserted (L or R), advance that pointer. Also, advance the pointer that points to the index which will be inserted next in the result array.
##### Steps:
1. Create result array of the same size, L and R, and an pointer to keep track of the position at the result array
2. Iterate while left and right haven't passed
3. Calculate square of number at each pointer and compare them
4. Whichever one is larger, insert that one to the result array and advance the respective pointer
5. Position pointer needs to be advanced in every case

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * len(nums)
        
        # l, r to keep track of number in nums list
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1

        # keep track of index in res list
        pos = len(nums) - 1            

        # iterate while pointers haven't passed
        while l <= r:
            # calc square for each pointer
            square_l = nums[l] ** 2
            square_r = nums[r] ** 2

            # square L > R
            if square_l > square_r:
                # need to insert square L
                res[pos] = square_l

                # advance L to the next number
                l += 1
            # square L <= R
            else:
                # need to insert square R
                res[pos] = square_r

                # advane R to the next number
                r -= 1
            
            # advance pos
            pos -= 1
        
        return res
```
