# [232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

Difficulty:  #Easy 
Topic:  #Stack #Queue
Hint: In queue, rear is used for enqueue, front for dequeue

###### Short description:
The problem requires implementing a FIFO queue using two stacks.

### Explanation:

Create two lists - back and front. Back list will be used to add elements to the queue and front list for peek and removal operations. When inserting, insert at index 0 to push element that was initially inserted further back. When removing, transfer the last element (this element was the first inserted) to the front stack and pop the element from the front stack. Since elements from the front stack are popped right after their insertion, this guarantees that the inserted element will be the one getting popped. For peek operation, append the last element of the back list to front list (without removing it from the back list), then pop the front list. To check whether the list is empty, return sum of the lengths of both lists.

### Code:

```python
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.back = []
        self.front = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        # enqueue at beginning
        self.back.insert(0, x)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        # remove first inserted element from back and enqueue it to front
        self.front.append(self.back.pop())

        # pop element from front
        return self.front.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        # append last element from back to front
        self.front.append(self.back[-1])

        # return the element from front
        return self.front.pop()

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.back) + len(self.front) == 0
        


# Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyQueue()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.peek()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
```
