# [232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

Difficulty: #Easy 
Topic: #Stack #Queue 
Hint: When popping elements from the back and appending them to front, the order reverses

### Explanation:
Initialize two stacks back and front. When pushing elements, everything will be added to the stack representing back of the queue. For popping and peeking, however, it is needed to get the first element on the back stack. Since in stack it is not possible to access the firstly inserted element directly, pop everything to the front stack. This way the order will be reversed, and the element on the top of the stack will be the firstly inserted element. Pop that element from the front stack. For checking whether queue is empty or not, it is enough to verify whether both stacks are empty or not.
### Code:

```python
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.back = []
        self.front = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        # add elements to the back
        self.back.append(x)


    def pop(self) -> int:
        # if front not empty, return element from it
        if self.front:
            return self.front.pop()
        
        # if front is empty, pop everything from the back to front (reverses order)
        while self.back:
            self.front.append(self.back.pop())
        
        # then return element from the front
        return self.front.pop()
        

    def peek(self) -> int:
        # if front not empty, return top from it
        if self.front:
            return self.front[-1]
        
        # if front is empty, pop everything from back to front (reverses order)
        while self.back:
            self.front.append(self.back.pop())
        
        # then return top of the front
        return self.front[-1]
            

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        # if both stacks are empty
        return max(len(self.front), len(self.back)) == 0
```
